## FooD Restaurant Website

I've developed a website called **FooD Restaurant** that allows users to browse food items, add them to a cart, and remove them from the cart. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.

### Features:

- **Food Item Display**: View a list of food items available at the restaurant.
- **Cart Functionality**: Add items to the cart and remove them as needed.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a user-friendly interface on any screen size.
